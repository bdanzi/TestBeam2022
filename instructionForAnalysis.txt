# Note to run the analysis in interactive mode

Brunella D'Anzi 9 July 2022

First you should have ROOT files already converted!! Go to instructionsForConversion.txt
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
In general the run number refers to a particular configuration which is written in the excel file.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Here the line command for the analysis code:

IMPORTANT : open another Terminal SHELL w.r.t. where you are doing the root file conversion
IMPORTANT: change the path to your LOCAL AREA!!!
cd dchdatareade_test_beam/WaveData
make clean
make
cd dchdatareade_test_beam/
make clean
make
cmsrel CMSSW_10_6_22
cd CMSSW_10_6_22/src
cmsenv
NOTE on cmsenv command: IF it doens't work, on lxplus do the following command: cmsrel CMSSW_10_6_22 and go to src subdirectory and do cmsenv again
cd testbeam_analysis
source setDCDataReaderEnv.sh
bash compile.sh
bash submit_first_RatioGasMixtures.sh

( within it you run on multiple root files a command similar to this one - with some additional parameters explained there: ./read_data . 91 0 -1 1.2 4 0 1.0 0.5 25.0 1024
where in the last code line: 

- 91 is the run number

- 0 -10 is the number of events to be processed (-1 to process the whole data set)

- 1.2 is the sampling rate

- 4, 0, 1.0, 0.5 are the cuts on the signal amplitude, first and second derivatives before starting the search for electron peaks (see FindPeak-algo.C))
bash submit_second_RatioGasMixtures.sh is (This command is used to produce the correspoding plots, please change the path to your favourite directory to store them!!)
